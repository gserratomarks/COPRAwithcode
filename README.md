# COPRAwithcode
MATLAB Code for using COPRA (Breitenbach et al 2012, http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-8-1765-2012) without a GUI.
This code is adapted from COPRA's built-in example_script.m. 
Note that I am not affiliated with the original COPRA authors. If you use this code, make sure you cite the original authors of COPRA: Breitenbach et al., 2012.
You can download COPRA from here: https://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/copra.php
